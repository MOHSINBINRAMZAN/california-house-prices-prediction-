## Project Description: California House Price Prediction using AI


### Objectives
- Build a reliable regression model for house price prediction.
- Preprocess and analyze housing data.
- Achieve high accuracy through evaluation and fine-tuning.

### Dataset
Use a housing dataset containing features such as median income, house age, total rooms, and location data.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Collect, inspect, and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and normalize features.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract and create relevant features.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. **Model Training**
   - Apply regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Split data into training and validation sets.
   - Train and validate the model.
4. **Evaluation and Fine-Tuning**
   - Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
5. **Deployment**
   - Save and deploy the model for use in predicting house prices.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Quality:** Clean data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Selection:** Use statistical methods to select important features.
- **Model Performance:** Fine-tune hyperparameters and use ensemble methods.

### Outcomes
- Accurate house price predictions.
- Insights into factors affecting house prices.
- A useful tool for real estate market analysis.
